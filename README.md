This project is a assignment of the Full stack development course I am following at CodeInstitute to show my skills with HTML5 and CSS3 so far. 

Lon's photo-shop is a website designed to sell photo's that the photographer (me) has made over the last couple of years whilst travelling, the website allows 
the users to see the photos and buy a print out version in different sizes that will be send to them via post. By introducing myself to the users there's 
a certain kind of trust build up, the user's will also be able to see more photographs and information about me in the links leading to the different 
social media platforms I use. If the user would like to come directly into contact with me there is also a posibility to send a direct message on the site itself. 
The personal information that is collected with the process of buying will not be sold to a third party which will be stated in the privacy policy provided at 
the bottom of the page. 

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
## UX

*Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project 
is the best way to help them achieve these things.* 

Lon's photo-shop is meant for people that are interested in photography and in this case mine specifically. They might have seen some of my work somewhere 
else online and now want to have some of it for themselves. So by making this website I give the users the ability to get a print out for themselves and to get 
to know me and my work even more. 

Section/Features | User stories
------------ | -------------
Home | As a user, I want to know what this website is about so I can see if I have arrived where I want to be.
About | As a user, I want to know more about the person behind the project (photograph's) so that I know the origin and if it's trustworthy.
Photographs | As a user, I want to see the content on this website so that I could potentially do something with it.
Purchase Photograph(s) | As a user, I got interested in the content and want to purchase some of it so that I can have it for my own.
Contact | As a user, I want to come into contact with the person behind the content so that I can ask questions, get more information or just to communicate with the person portrayed on this website.
Navigation/menu bar | As a user, I want to be able to go to certain parts of the website easily so that I don't have to scroll throuht the whole content.
Alert/sale bar | As a user, I want to know if certain deals or discounts are going on so that I'm more willing to buy something at that specific moment.
Social media links | As a user, I liked the content and want to be able to go to the person's social media platforms so that I can see more and/or come into contact.

Privacy policy | As a user, I want to know what happens with the information I fill in so that I know it's save to do so.

*This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should 
themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is 
viewable inside the browser.*



## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features

    Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
    ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, 
provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this 
part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and 
straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and 
explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for 
describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
