<h1 align="center">MS1 (Shashin)</h1>

[Go to the project here.](https://lonneke-dev.github.io/ms1/)

This project is an assignment of the Full stack development course I am following at CodeInstitute to show my skills with HTML5 and CSS3 so far. 

<h4 align="left"><img src="assets/images/screenshot.png"></h4> 

Shashin is meant for people that are interested in photography and in this case mine specifically. They might have seen some of my work somewhere 
else online and now want to have some of it for themselves. So by making this website I give the users the ability to get a print out for themselves and to get 
to know me and my work even more.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know more about the person behind the project (photograph's) so that I know the origin and if it's trustworthy.
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see the content of the photograph section on a bigger scale. 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find more photographs and potentially purchase something.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in to contact so I could ask questions and get more information.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added photos or products.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to know what happens with the information I grant this website and if it is safe.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to know if there's anything new and if there are any discounts.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used in this project are different shades of purple (rgb(199, 199, 245) & rgb(131, 131, 246)) to make sure it doesn't interfere with the many photographs presented on the website.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Comfortaa font is used throughout the whole website for headings and the cover text to give a smooth but informal look to the website. 
        -   The Roboto font is used throughout the whole website for all the paragraphs because it's a common used font. So it's easy to read for the users.
        -   The Sans Serif fotn is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The Imagery is very important, especially on this website. So I went with a calm but still eyecatching hero-image to introduce the users 
            to the sort of images they can expect throughout the website.

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

        1. When users enter the site, they are greeted with an easily readable navigation bar to go to any section on the page together with a removeable alertbar to inform them about discounts, which sticks to the top of the page for easy access.

    4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to see the content of the photograph section on a bigger scale. 
    
        1. By having the photos slightly change when you hover over them it makes it clear to the users that they are clickable.
        2. When the users click on the photos the photo opens in a separate page filling up the whole screen.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on multiple browsers and a variety of devices;
    <img src="assets/images/functionality.png">
-   A large amount of testing was done on responsiveness and functionality.

### Known Bugs

-   In some browsers the vertical images show horizontally unless they are opened in a separate tab by clicking on them.

-   Navbar collapsed didn't show the background correctly : By changing the height of the navbar back to normal it showed the background correctly again.
-   On chrome when decreasing the screen size you could move the website horizontally : By getting rid of the live instagram post and making all margins and padding throughout the website the same the problem was fixed.
-   The equipment image in the about section didn't align nicely with the bottom : by giving the image extra top padding on a large screen size the image was nicely aligned.
-   Gaps in the about section on smaller screen sizes : I created a mediaquery to decide the padding on a bigger screensize so the smaller screensizes have minimum padding.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lonneke-dev/ms1
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lonneke-dev/ms1
